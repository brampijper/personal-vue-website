# personal-vue-website

I'm building a website that will display my recent projects on Github.(like a portfolio)
Every project hosted on this website will feature a live demo to see what I've build.
I'm developing this project with Vue.js, Sass + Webpack. 

This project is now being hosted on: www.bramsprojects.space
/note - It works best on Chrome for now (working on cross browser support)
